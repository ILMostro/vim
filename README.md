###Lightweight version of Vim

Lightweight version of `Vim` stripped from Windows, Mac, and other OS
support, leaving Linux and Unix support only.

If you're looking to install Vim on any OS other than Linux and,
perhaps, Unix take a look at the official upstream project page
at https://www.vim.org/sources.php
